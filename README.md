## Description

"Random Search with Unique Numbers" is a simple web application that allows users to perform unique random searches on Bing in new Edge windows. The application generates random search queries using a predefined list of words combined with random numbers, ensuring that each search is unique. This project is intended to make it easier for users to perform unique searches and earn Bing reward points for their searches.
